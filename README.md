This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

This project was born from the need to have a structured React project and with the basic things that I consider necessary.
